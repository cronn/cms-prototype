## üöÄ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ i18n/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc.mjs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ astro.config.mjs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ eslint.config.mjs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tailwind.config.mjs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. To avoid duplication, each page is built with a component that handles translated data and all the rest. Page components are located in `src/component/pages`.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Translations for both German and English are placed in the `src/i18n/locales` folder as JSON files. If you add new JSON files, you need to include them in both `germanNamespaces.ts` and `englishNamespaces.ts`. Helper functions can be found in `src/i18n/utils` and namespace validation in `src/i18n/index`. Translation logic is more or less a custom solution and therefore a work in progress. It only supports static side rendering at the moment.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory. Moreover, everything related to Decap CMS configuration resides in `public/admin`. Bootsrapping Decap CMS is done via `public/admin/index.html`, which additionally contains custom widget components (like the quote component) for the Decap markdown editor. The main Decap configuration can be adjusted in `public/admin/config.yml` where every type of content collection needs to be defined and the Git provider connection is set up. To start a local Decap server, set **local_backend: true**, run **npx decap-server** and go to `localhost:4321/admin/index.html`. All markdown or json entries created via Decap will be placed in their respective subfolders in `src/content/`. Images uploaded to Decap CMS are stored in `src/images`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è To sync Decap CMS content collections (`public/admin/config.yml`) with Astro's content collections (`src/content/config.ts`), both configs and their type definitions need to match ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
